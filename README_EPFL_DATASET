NOTE on EPFL RGBD dataset (https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/Qd7H855d0w4fptO)

1. Data
- So far I have been working on 'epfl_lab' only. Their lab is an open space so I think it is better than 'epfl_corridor' which is captured in narrower and longer space.

2. Calibration matrix
- calibration.yaml
- Use this code to load yaml and undistort the image (using provided distortion coefficients)

"""
import numpy as np
import cv2
import yaml

yaml_lab = yaml.safe_load(open('./calibration.yaml', 'r'))
K_lab = np.array(yaml_lab['K])
Pwc_lab = np.array(yaml_lab['Pwc'])
dist_lab = np.array(yaml_lab['dist'])

img = cv2.imread('./epfl_lab/20140804_160621_00/rgb00000.png')
img_depth = cv2.imread('./epfl_lab/20140804_160621_00/depth00000.png', cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)

img_undist = cv2.undistort(img, K_lab, dist_lab, None)
"""

3. Ground truth
- 'ground_truth_image_plane.yaml': bounding boxes in the image coordinates (to test the accuracy of EfficientDet) 
- 'ground_truth_ground_plane.yaml': location in the ground plane. This will be compared against the bottom center location of the bounding box from EfficientDet after being IPM'ed.
